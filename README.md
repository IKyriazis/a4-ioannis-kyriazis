This project is meant to be a place for an administrator to post items for sale. The administrator goes to /admin.html
to add, edit, and delete different posts in the database. A user can create an account or log in from /index.html.
The user is also able to view all the posts from there. I've faced many challenges trying to implement this idea. For one,
passport.js was very confusing to use and I still don't have the hang of it. I chose the username and password strategy
for passport.js. I used the water.css framework because it was the easiest to use. I used body-parser to make JSON parsing
easier. I used passport for implementing login. I used passport-local to implement the username/password strategy. I used 
express-session to have a log in session through passport. I used connect-flash to allow passportjs to work.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the username/password strategy.
- **Tech Acievement 2**: I migrated my code to heroku

## Design Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Modified css framework because button text had extra top padding
